            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A new Diſcovery of ſeuerall paſſages, performed by the Malignant Party, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>VVHen the Parliament endeavoured to worke a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the great diſorders, both in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Civill State, this their pious proceedings drew a more particular envy and <hi>odium</hi> upon it; than was uſuall to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Parliaments, &amp; was the firſt cauſe that thoſe, who had ſwallowed up in their thoughts our Religion and Liberties, &amp; now ſaw themſelves defeated by this meanes, bended all their endeavours, and rayſed all their forces to deſtroy it, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they carryed the King from the Parliament to Yorke, and poſſeſt him with ſuch a hatred of the Parliament, ſo that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of a defenſive guard, hee hath by the adviſe of this Malignant party rayſed a great Army.</p>
            <p>This malignant party if the word bee taken in the largeſt ſence, are all thoſe who upon different bad reſpects and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their owne wicked purpoſes, have alienated the Kings affections from the Parliament, ſet this Kingdome into the combuſtion of a Civill Warre, and either fearing reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſeeking preferment by betraying their Countrey, to ſerve the Court have combined to bury the happineſſe of this Kingdome in the ruine of the Parliament, and afterward to effect that which was firſt in their intention, that is, the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of an arbitrary government, and the changing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into Popery and Superſtition.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35723:4"/>
            <p>The name and title of malignant party (now ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed) may bee derived from <hi>male agens</hi> or from doing and contriving that which is wicked and evill, as being a company of Royaliſts gathered about the King, who for their owne ſafety being moſt of them delinquents and other ill affected perſons, do endeavour like ſo many <hi>Phaethons</hi> to ſet the whole Kingdome of England on fire, that ſo they may ſee it ruinated in the flames of a Civill warre.</p>
            <p>They pretend that they are the Kings friends, and to give a faire colour to their malignant purpoſes they are fu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend the Kingdome even to the utmoſt hazard of their lives and eſtates, and as they formerly endeavoured and alſo have prevayled in ſettting the King againſt the Parliament, ſo now they have perſwaded his Maieſtie to ſet up his Standard, to raiſe a great Army, and to give them power and authority under the name of Cavaleers to commit divers outragious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies in the Countrey, while they goe about by violence to put in execution the illegall Commiſſion of Array.</p>
            <p>The people that doe make up this Malignant party, may be diſtinguiſhed into ſeverall ſorts and kinds, though all ayming at the ſubverſion of the Kingdome, and the converſion of the Proteſtant Religion into ſuperſtitious Popery, they being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſts or people popiſhly enclined, raſh unadviſed noble men, newtrall Proteſtants, decayed Gentlemen, Delinquents fearing puniſhment, cutting Cavaleers indebted perſons, looſe idle livers, inconſiderate giddy Gentlemen, ambitious diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Clergy men, and factious troubleſome Lawyers, all which have conſpired together to make a Malignant Army upon ſeverall wicked grounds and reaſons; The Papiſts ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the peace and welfare of this Kingdome, fearing that their religion ſhall bee utterly rooted out of this land, doe all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35723:4"/> they have ſo violently endeavoured to worke a generall reformation, and to extirpate their idolatrous ſuperſtition. The unadviſed Noble men to gratifie &amp; pleaſe the King though againſt their own Countrey, have by their purſes and preſence encouraged the Kings Maieſtie to a Civill War The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men well deſcended, but of weake and decayd eſtates, conceive Civill Warre to bee the beſt way ſuddenly to rayſe their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. The Cavaleers loving to fiſh in troubled waters, doe imagine that the diſſention of a Civill Warre will bee their time of harveſt. Others caring not what the cauſe of the warre be being indebted and rather than they will take paynes in their calling, have recourſe unto the warres onely for ſecurity and preſent maintenance Giddy brain'd Gentlemen follow theſe, miſſed by ſcandalous reports, and falſe ſurmiſes of the Parliaments proceedings. The diſcontented Clergy-men and ambitious Lawyers, although they are no ſouldiers yet being armed with malicious tongues, the Divine by his preaching and doctrine doth endeavour to ſtirre up diſſention and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Civill Warre, and the Lawyer againſt conſcience and equity doth poſſeſſe the King with quirkes of Law, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him to proſecute illegall courſes according to their evill counſells</p>

            <p>Theſe and the like are the intentions of the malignant party, who are now gathered into a mighty Army, and amongſt the reſt the Cavaleers being the Champions of the malignants do commit divers outragious inſolencies in ſeverall countryes, killing, robbing and ſlaying whereſoever they come, ſetting houſes on fire, and keeping the Countrey in ſuch ſubiection that they dare not hardly looke out of doores, riding along as aſſiſtants unto thoſe that have commiſſion to compell his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties Subiects to ſubmit to the illegall Commiſſion of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, thereby to ſtrengthen themſelves by leauying forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And what is the end, in perſuance whereof they have thus traiterouſly combined againſt this Parliament? Is it not to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine this Parliament that hath ſet a ſtop to the violence ſo long by them intended? Is it not to induce an alteration of Religion, &amp; the ſubverſion of the Lawes &amp; liberties of the Kingdome? Is it not plainely to bring in popery &amp; Idolatry together with an arbitrary forme of government, that ſo tyranny accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with mercileſſe taxes (leavied according to the fancy of a favorite) ſhould not leave the common people anything which they may call their own, all being at the wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
